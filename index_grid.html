        </a><br>

        Soybeans are also called "Meat from the field" because they contain the neccesary fat and proteins and they are
        a nutritious
        food.
        In Japan, soy beans have been cultivated since 1000 B.C. <br><br>

        <br><br>
        Soybeans are processed into various products. Miso and soy sauce are essential condiments in Japanese culture.
        Also tofu, natto(fermented soybeans), and edamame are seen on tables everyday.
        In recent years, soy milk has become popular in the U.S. as well, as an alternative to cow milk.

                <article><h4>Miso</h4>
                It is a brown paste type condiment for dipping and marinating. Mixing some into dashi broth makes the
                famous
                miso-soup.
                Cooking soy beans and adding rice or oats with fermentation starter create "Koji", which is then used to
                make Miso. Different
                regions make different types of miso.
                Here is a recipe that uses miso
                <br><br>

                <aside><h4>Soy Sauce</h4>
                It is a dark colored liquid type condiment. Soy sauce is used as a dipping sauce for sushi and sashimi,
                and it can be added into almost any
                cooking to create more deep, earthy flavore ;)
                To make soy sauce, soybeans are steamed and then stir fried. The beans are then mixed with wheat and
                "Koji" and salt are added. The liquid part after fermentation is
                soy sauce. </aside>

            <a id="article"><h4>Edamame</h4>
                Salty cooked green beans that go well with beer in summer.
                Soy beans are cultivated later, but the beans eaten as edamame are cultivated when they are still green.
                Edamame contain various vitamins, minerals and protein, and can help you recover faster from fatigue and
                boost liver
                function.

                <h4>Tofu</h4>
                White soft squares that are used in many dishes as a source of protein.
                Tofu is made from soy milk. When warmed soy milk is mixed with "Nigari", it creates a pudding-like
                fluffy texture.
                Freshly made tofu is so delicious,even only with a little salt on top.

        <div class="maintitle"> <h2>But....</h2></div><br>
    So many foods that don't look like soy beans are made from soy beans, as if they are sneakingly invading the earth.
    In fact, it is true that places where soy beans are farmed are drastically increasing, and this causes deforestation
    because it
    requires a lot of water to grow.
    However, much of this soybean crop is not consumed by humans, but instead used in meat, dairy, and egg industries.
    Around 80% of soy bean production is used to feed live stock.<br><br>

    <div class="maintitle"><h2>So what to do?</h2></div>
    </a>
    <br>

    <p>
        <div class="center" ><span>Eat more soybean products as a protein source and eat less meat! </span></div>
        <br><br>It sounds contradictory to recommend consuming
        more soy
        beans that cause all of those bad things
        like increasing carbon emissions and strain water sources. However, most soy beans are fed to livestock.
        If you ate soy beans instead of meat,
        "agricultural deforestation would decline by as much as 94%" and it is much more sustainable.
